<p>
PAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUND POLICY
</p>

<p>
The iTunes Store, App Store, and iBookstore services (“Services”) accept these forms of payment: credit cards issued by U.S. banks, payments through your PayPal account, iTunes Cards, iTunes Store Gift Certificates, Content Codes, and Allowance Account balances. If a credit card or your PayPal account is being used for a transaction, Apple may obtain preapproval for an amount up to the amount of the order. Billing occurs at the time of or shortly after your transaction. If you are using 1-Click purchasing or your PayPal account, your order may be authorized and billed in increments during one purchasing session, so it may appear as multiple orders on your statement. If an iTunes Card, iTunes Store Gift Certificate, or Allowance Account is used for a transaction, the amount is deducted at the time of your transaction. When making purchases, content credits are used first, followed by Gift Certificate, iTunes Card, or Allowance Account credits; your credit card or PayPal account is then charged for any remaining balance.
</p>

<p>
You agree that you will pay for all products you purchase through the Services, and that Apple may charge your credit card or PayPal account for any products purchased and for any additional amounts (including any taxes and late fees, as applicable) that may be accrued by or in connection with your Account. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL FEES AND FOR PROVIDING APPLE WITH A VALID CREDIT CARD OR PAYPAL ACCOUNT DETAILS FOR PAYMENT OF ALL FEES. All fees will be billed to the credit card or PayPal account you designate during the registration process. If you want to designate a different credit card or if there is a change in your credit card or PayPal account status, you must change your information online in the Account Information section of iTunes; this may temporarily disrupt your access to the Services while Apple verifies your new payment information.
</p>

<p>
Your total price will include the price of the product plus any applicable sales tax; such sales tax is based on the bill-to address and the sales tax rate in effect at the time you download the product. We will charge tax only in states where digital goods are taxable.
</p>

<p>
All sales and rentals of products are final.
</p>

<p>
Prices for products offered via the Services may change at any time, and the Services do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or promotional offering.
</p>

<p>
If a product becomes unavailable following a transaction but prior to download, your sole remedy is a refund. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of your product, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement or refund of the price paid, as determined by Apple.
</p>

<p>
1-Click®
</p>

<p>
1-Click is a registered service mark of Amazon.com, Inc., used under license. 1-Click is a convenient feature that allows you to make a purchase from the Services with a single click of your mouse or other input device.

</p>

<p>
When you opt in to the Genius feature, Apple will, from time to time, automatically collect information that can be used to identify media in your iTunes library on this computer, such as your play history and playlists. This includes media purchased through iTunes and media obtained from other sources. This information will be stored anonymously and not associated with your name or iTunes Account. When you use the Genius feature, Apple will use this information and the contents of your iTunes library, as well as other information, to give personalized recommendations to you.
</p>

<p>
Apple may only use this information and combine it with aggregated information from the iTunes libraries of other users who also opt in to this feature, your iTunes Store purchase history data, aggregated purchase history data from other iTunes Store users, and other information obtained from third parties, to:
</p>

<p>
• Create personalized playlists for you from your iTunes library.
</p>

<p>
• Provide you with recommendations regarding media and other products and services that you may wish to purchase.
</p>

<p>
• Provide recommendations regarding products and services to other users.
</p>

<p>
At all times your information will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
Once you opt in to the Genius feature in iTunes, you will be able to create Genius playlists on Genius-capable devices. To enable the Genius feature on a device, you must sync it with your iTunes library after you have opted in.
</p>

<p>
If you prefer that we do not collect and use information from your iTunes library in this manner, you should not enable the Genius feature. You can revoke your opt-in choice at any time by turning off the Genius feature from the Store menu in iTunes on your computer. After you opt out, iTunes will no longer send information about your iTunes library to Apple. If you have elected to share your library from multiple computers, you need to turn off the Genius feature from each computer. The Genius feature cannot be enabled or disabled from your device.
</p>

<p>
By opting in to the Genius feature, you consent to the use of your information as described above and as described in Apple’s Privacy Policy.

</p>

<p>
Apple reserves the right to change content options (including eligibility for particular features) without notice.
</p>

<p>
USE OF PURCHASED OR RENTED CONTENT
</p>

<p>
You agree that the Service and certain Products include security technology that limits your use of Products and that, whether or not Products are limited by security technology, you shall use Products in compliance with the applicable usage rules established by Apple and its licensors (“Usage Rules”), and that any other use of the Products may constitute a copyright infringement. Any security technology is an inseparable part of the Products. Apple reserves the right to modify the Usage Rules at any time. You agree not to violate, circumvent, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise tamper with any of the security technology related to such Usage Rules for any reason—or to attempt or assist another person to do so. Usage Rules may be controlled and monitored by Apple for compliance purposes, and Apple reserves the right to enforce the Usage Rules without notice to you. You agree not to access the Service by any means other than through software that is provided by Apple for accessing the Service. You shall not access or attempt to access an Account that you are not authorized to access. You agree not to modify the software in any manner or form, or to use modified versions of the software, for any purposes including obtaining unauthorized access to the Service. Violations of system or network security may result in civil or criminal liability.
</p>

</p>

<p>
(ii) You shall be authorized to use Products on five Apple-authorized devices at any time, except for Content Rentals (see below).
</p>

<p>
(iii) You shall be able to store Products from up to five different Accounts at a time on compatible devices, provided that each iPhone may sync ringtone Products with only a single Apple-authorized device at a time, and syncing an iPhone with a different Apple-authorized device will cause ringtone Products stored on that iPhone to be erased.
</p>

<p>
(iv) You shall be authorized to burn an audio playlist up to seven times.
</p>

<p>
(v) You shall not be entitled to burn video Products or ringtone Products.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
(vii) You shall be able to manually sync a movie from at least one iTunes-authorized device to devices that have manual sync mode, provided that the movie is associated with an Account on the primary iTunes-authorized device, where the primary iTunes-authorized device is the one that was first synced with the device or the one that you subsequently designate as primary using iTunes.
</p>

<p>
(viii) An HDCP connection is required to view content transmitted over HDMI.
</p>

<p>

Content rented using your Apple TV, iPad, iPhone 4, or iPod touch (4th generation) may not be moved. If you move a rental to a compatible device and then use the Service to restore that device, or choose Settings > Reset > Erase all content and settings on that device, the rental will be permanently deleted.
</p>

<p>
(b) You have thirty (30) days after downloading a rental to begin viewing. Once you begin viewing, you have twenty-four (24) hours to finish viewing a movie, and forty-eight (48) hours to finish viewing a TV show. Stopping, pausing, or restarting a rental does not extend the available time for viewing.

Products may be downloaded only once and cannot be replaced if lost for any reason. Once a Product is downloaded, it is your responsibility not to lose, destroy, or damage it, and Apple shall not be liable to you if you do so.
</p>

<p>
The delivery of Products does not transfer to you any commercial or promotional use rights in the Products. Any burning or exporting capabilities are solely an accommodation to you and shall not constitute a grant, waiver, or other limitation of any rights of the copyright owners in any content embodied in any Product.
</p>

<p>
You acknowledge that, because some aspects of the Service, Products, and administration of the Usage Rules entails the ongoing involvement of Apple, if Apple changes any part of or discontinues the Service, which Apple may do at its election, you may not be able to use Products to the same extent as prior to such change or discontinuation, and that Apple shall have no liability to you in such case.
</p>

<p>
PING

You are solely responsible for the information that is associated with your Account that is made available on Ping. Apple may also use information provided, as well as information iTunes sends to Apple about the content you select in your iTunes library in order to provide you with Ping personal recommendations, such as suggesting other users you may want to follow, concerts and related information, or other Products you may want to purchase. By opting in to Ping, you consent to the use of such information in the manner described above. At all times your information will be treated in accordance with Apple's Privacy Policy. You should not opt in to Ping, or should opt out of Ping in your Account settings if you don't want others to view any information provided using your Account, including activity on iTunes. When you opt out, your information will be removed from view, and then deleted after seven days. If you opt out of Ping, or hide the Ping Sidebar, iTunes will no longer send information associated with the content you select in your iTunes library for Ping. You will be able to remove items from your Recent Activity if you do not want them to be visible to other users. Please take extra care when using these features.

<p>
USE OF PRODUCTS AND THE SERVICES
</p>

<p>
Solely as an accommodation to you, some Products may be redownloaded for use in accordance with the Usage Rules. Not all Products are eligible for this accommodation or may be available at any given time. Apple shall have no liability to you in the event that a previously downloaded Product becomes unavailable for redownload. Once a Product is downloaded, it is your responsibility not to lose, destroy, or damage it, and Apple shall not be liable to you if you do so.
</p>

<p>
You agree that the Services and certain Products include security technology that limits your use of Products and that, whether or not Products are limited by security technology, you shall use Products in compliance with the applicable usage rules established by Apple and its principals (“Usage Rules”), and that any other use of the Products may constitute a copyright infringement. Any security technology is an inseparable part of the Products. Apple reserves the right to modify the Usage Rules at any time. You agree not to violate, circumvent, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise tamper with any of the security technology related to such Usage Rules for any reason—or to attempt or assist another person to do so. Usage Rules may be controlled and monitored by Apple for compliance purposes, and Apple reserves the right to enforce the Usage Rules without notice to you. You agree not to access the Services by any means other than through software that is provided by Apple for accessing the Services. You shall not access or attempt to access an Account that you are not authorized to access. You agree not to modify the software in any manner or form, or to use modified versions of the software, for any purposes including obtaining unauthorized access to the Services. Violations of system or network security may result in civil or criminal liability.
</p>

<p>
The delivery of Products does not transfer to you any promotional use rights in the Products.
</p>

<p>
You acknowledge that, because some aspects of the Services, Products, and administration of the Usage Rules entails the ongoing involvement of Apple, if Apple changes any part of or discontinues the Services, which Apple may do at its election, you may not be able to use Products to the same extent as prior to such change or discontinuation, and that Apple shall have no liability to you in such case.

<p>
ADDITIONAL APP STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
</p>

<p>
LICENSE OF APP STORE PRODUCTS
</p>

<p>
The software products made available through the App Store (the “App Store Products”) are licensed, not sold, to you. There are two (2) categories of App Store Products, as follows: (i) those App Store Products that have been developed, and are licensed to you, by Apple (the “Apple Products”); and (ii) those App Store Products that have been developed, and are licensed to you, by a third-party developer (the “Third-Party Products”). The category of a particular App Store Product (Apple Product or Third-Party Product) is identified on the App Store Service application.
</p>

<p>
Your license to each App Store Product is subject to the Licensed Application End User License Agreement set forth below. You agree that the terms of the Licensed Application End User License Agreement will apply to each Apple Product and to each Third-Party Product that you license through the App Store Service, unless the App Store Product is covered by a valid end user license agreement entered into between you and the licensor of the App Store Product (the “Licensor”), in which case the Licensor’s end user license agreement will apply to that App Store Product. The Licensor reserves all rights in and to the App Store Product not expressly granted to you.
</p>

<p>
You acknowledge that the license you purchase to each Apple Product that you obtain through the App Store Service is a binding agreement between you and Apple. You acknowledge that: you are purchasing the license to each Third-Party Product from the third-party licensor of that Third-Party Product (the “Application Provider”); Apple is acting as agent for the Application Provider in providing each such Third-Party Product to you; and Apple is not a party to the license between you and the Application Provider with respect to that Third-Party Product. The Application Provider of each Third-Party Product is solely responsible for that Third-Party Product, the content therein, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have not been disclaimed, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to that Third-Party Product.
</p>

<p>
You acknowledge and agree that Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of the Licensed Application End User License Agreement or the Application Provider’s end user license agreement, as the case may be, for each Third-Party Product. You also agree that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the license to any such Third-Party Product, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce such license against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.
</p>

<p>
Certain App Store Products may include functionality that enables you to purchase additional services, or licenses to additional functionality or content for use within the App Store Product ("In App Purchases"). In App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App Store Product (for example, virtual ammunition) cannot be transferred among devices; can be downloaded only once; and after being downloaded, cannot be replaced. Once a consumable In App Purchase is purchased and received by you, Apple shall be without liability to you in the event of any loss, destruction, or damage. All In App Purchases are deemed App Store Products, and In App Purchases made within Third-Party Products are deemed Third-Party Products, and treated as such, for purposes of these terms and conditions.
</p>

<p>
GENIUS FOR APPS
</p>

<p>
When you opt in to the Genius for Apps feature, Apple will, from time to time, automatically collect information related to the applications on your device, such as your time spent with each application and the number of times each application is launched. This information will be stored anonymously and not associated with your name or iTunes Account. When you use the Genius for Apps feature, Apple will use this information, as well as other information, such as your application download history, to give personalized recommendations to you.
</p>

<p>
Apple may use this information and combine it with aggregated information from other users who opt in to this feature, your iTunes Store purchase history data, your App Store download data, aggregated application download data from other users, and other information like customer ratings of applications, to:
</p>

<p>
• Provide you with recommendations regarding applications, media, and other products and services that you may wish to purchase, download, or use.
</p>

<p>
• Provide recommendations to other users.
</p>

<p>
At all times your information will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Customer Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
Once you opt in to the Genius for Apps feature on a Genius-capable device, you will be able to create Genius recommendations on that device.
</p>

<p>
If you prefer that we do not collect and use information from your device in this manner, you should not enable the Genius feature. You can opt out at any time by turning off the Genius feature from the App Store Account page on your device. If you have elected to share Genius for Apps information from multiple devices, you need to turn off the Genius feature from each device to opt out.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
</p>

<p>
To avoid muscle, joint, or eye strain during video game play, you should always take frequent breaks from playing, and take a longer rest if you experience any soreness, fatigue, or discomfort. A very small percentage of people may experience seizures or blackouts when exposed to flashing lights or patterns, including while playing video games or watching videos. Symptoms may include dizziness, nausea, involuntary movements, loss of awareness, altered vision, tingling, numbness, or other discomforts. Consult a doctor before playing video games if you have ever suffered these or similar symptoms, and stop playing immediately and see a doctor if they occur during game play. Parents should monitor their children’s video game play for signs of symptoms.
</p>

<p>
IPOD GAMES
</p>

<p>
Updates to your existing compatible iPod device’s firmware may render your purchased version of an iPod Game incompatible. Games purchased from the iTunes Store may not be compatible with future generations of the iPod.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Apple will be responsible for providing any maintenance and support services with respect to the Apple Products only, as specified in the Licensed Application End User License Agreement or the separate end user license agreement, as the case may be, or as required under applicable law.

LICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
</p>

<p>
The App Store Products made available through the App Store Service are licensed, not sold, to you. Your license to each App Store Product that you obtain through the App Store Service is subject to your prior acceptance of this Licensed Application End User License Agreement, and you agree that the terms of this Licensed Application End User License Agreement will apply to each App Store Product that you license through the App Store Service, unless that App Store Product is covered by a valid end user license agreement entered into between you and the Licensor of that App Store Product, in which case the terms of that separate end user license agreement will govern, subject to your prior acceptance of that separate end user license agreement. Your license to any Apple Product under this Licensed Application End User License Agreement is granted by Apple, and your license to any Third-Party Product under this Licensed Application End User License Agreement is granted by the Licensor of that Third-Party Product. Any App Store Product that is subject to the license granted under this Licensed Application End User License Agreement is referred to herein as the “Licensed Application”. Licensor reserves all rights in and to the Licensed Application not expressly granted to you under this Licensed Application End User License Agreement.
</p>

<p>
a. Scope of License: This license granted to you for the Licensed Application by Licensor is limited to a nontransferable license to use the Licensed Application on any iOS-based device (including but not limited to iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch) that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the App Store Terms and Conditions (the “Usage Rules”). This license does not allow you to use the Licensed Application on any iOS-based device that you do not own or control, and you may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Licensed Application. You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Licensed Application). Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of the Licensor and its licensors. If you breach this restriction, you may be subject to prosecution and damages.
</p>

<p>
The terms of the license will govern any upgrades provided by Licensor that replace and/or supplement the original App Store Product, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.
</p>

<p>
b. Consent to Use of Data: You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed Application. Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.
</p>

<p>
c. Termination. The license is effective until terminated by you or Licensor. Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice from the Licensor if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this license. Upon termination of the license, you shall cease all use of the Licensed Application and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Licensed Application.
</p>

<p>
d. Services; Third-Party Materials. The Licensed Application may enable access to Licensor’s and third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, "External Services"). Use of the External Services may require Internet access and your acceptance of additional terms of service.
</p>

<p>
You understand that by using any of the External Services, you may encounter content that you may deem to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and that such content may or may not be identified as having explicit language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree that you will use the External Services at your sole risk and that the Licensor shall not have any liability to you for content that you may find offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
</p>

<p>
Certain External Services may display, include, or make available content, data, information, applications, or materials from third parties (“Third-Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third-party websites. By using the External Services, you acknowledge and agree that the Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality, or any other aspect of such Third-Party Materials or websites. The Licensor does not warrant or endorse and will not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other person for any third-party External Services, Third-Party Materials or websites, or any other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third-Party Materials and links to other websites are provided solely as a convenience to you. Financial information displayed by any External Services is for general informational purposes only and is not intended to be relied on as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based on information obtained through the External Services, you should consult with a financial professional. Location data provided by any External Services is for basic navigational purposes only and is not intended to be relied on in situations where precise location information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. Use of real-time route guidance is at your sole risk. Location data may not be accurate. Neither the Licensor nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of stock information or location data displayed by any External Services.
</p>

<p>
You agree that any External Services contain proprietary content, information, and material that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright, and that you will not use such proprietary content, information, or materials in any way whatsoever except for permitted use of the External Services. No portion of the External Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the External Services in any manner, and you shall not exploit the External Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including, but not limited to, by trespass or burdening network capacity. You further agree that you will not use the External Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten, defame, or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that the Licensor is not in any way responsible for any such use by you, or for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive, or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the External Services.
</p>

<p>
In addition, third-party External Services and Third-Party Materials that may be accessed from, displayed on, or linked to from the iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch are not available in all languages or in all countries. The Licensor makes no representation that such External Services and Materials are appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to access such External Services or Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws. The Licensor, and its licensors, reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any External Services at any time without notice. In no event will the Licensor be liable for the removal or disabling of access to any such External Services. The Licensor may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain External Services, in any case and without notice or liability.
</p>

<p>
e. NO WARRANTY: YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE LICENSED APPLICATION ("SERVICES") ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN OR SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE LICENSED APPLICATION WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION.

D. PRIVACY POLICY
</p>

<p>
Your privacy is important to Apple. So we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.
</p>

<p>
Collection and Use of Personal Information
</p>

<p>
Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person.
</p>

<p>
You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company. Apple and it’s affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.
</p>

<p>
Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may use it.
</p>

<p>
What personal information we collect
</p>

<p>
■	When you create an Apple ID, register your products, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, and credit card information.
</p>

<p>
■	When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to join you on Apple forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.
</p>

<p>
■	In the U.S., we may ask for your Social Security number (SSN) but only in limited circumstances such as when setting up a wireless account and activating your iPhone or when determining whether to extend commercial credit.
</p>

<p>
How we use your personal information
</p>

<p>
■	The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple’s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. It also helps us to improve our services, content, and advertising. If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences.
</p>

<p>
■	We also use personal information to help us develop, deliver, and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.
</p>

<p>
■	From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.
</p>

<p>
■	We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple’s products, services, and customer communications.
</p>

<p>
■	If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.
</p>

<p>
Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information
</p>

<p>
We also collect non-personal information − data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:
</p>

<p>
■	We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, location, and the time zone where an Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.
</p>

<p>
■	We also may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, MobileMe service, and iTunes Store and from our other products and services. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.
</p>

<p>
Cookies and Other Technologies
</p>

<p>
Apple’s website, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
Apple and its partners use cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. If you do not want to receive ads with this level of relevance on your mobile device, you can opt out by accessing the following link on your device: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20101220203736/http://oo.apple.com/">http://oo.apple.com</a>. If you opt out, you will continue to receive the same number of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests. You may still see ads related to the content on a web page or in an application or based on other non-personal information. This opt-out applies only to Apple advertising services and does not affect interest-based advertising from other advertising networks.
</p>

<p>
Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your country and language − and if you are an educator, your school − helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, product serial numbers, and information about your computer or device helps us register your products, personalize your operating system, set up your MobileMe service, and provide you with better customer service.
</p>

<p>
If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the Security pane to disable cookies. On your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, and then to the Cookies section. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled.
</p>

<p>
As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
</p>

<p>
We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.
</p>

<p>
In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Apple website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.
</p>

<p>
Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.
</p>

<p>
Disclosure to Third Parties
</p>

<p>
At times Apple may make certain personal information available to strategic partners that work with Apple to provide products and services, or that help Apple market to customers. For example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Apple and its carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service. If you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and its carrier’s respective privacy policies. Personal information will only be shared by Apple to provide or improve our products, services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.
</p>

<p>
Service Providers
</p>

<p>
Apple shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Apple operates.
</p>

<p>
Others
</p>

<p>
It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for Apple to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.
</p>

<p>
We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.
</p>

<p>
Protection of Personal Information
</p>

<p>
Apple takes precautions — including administrative, technical, and physical measures — to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
</p>

<p>
Apple online services such as the Apple Online Store and iTunes Store use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is collected. To make purchases from these services, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Safari, Firefox, or Internet Explorer. Doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal information while it’s transmitted over the Internet.
</p>

<p>
When you use some Apple products, services, or applications or post on an Apple forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.
</p>

<p>
Integrity and Retention of Personal Information
</p>

<p>
Apple makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
</p>

<p>
Access to Personal Information
</p>

<p>
You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by logging in to your account at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20101220203736/http://www.apple.com/contact/myinfo">www.apple.com/contact/myinfo</a>. For other personal information, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access so you can request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Apple is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. Access, correction, or deletion requests can be made to the regional Privacy email addresses.
</p>

<p>
Children
</p>

<p>
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
Location-Based Services
</p>

<p>
To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device. This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services. For example, we may share geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.
</p>

<p>
Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the MobileMe “Find My iPhone” feature, require your personal information for the feature to work.
</p>

<p>
Third-Party Sites and Services
</p>

<p>
Apple websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. Our products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties − for example, a third-party iPhone app. Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.
</p>

<p>
International Users
</p>

<p>
Information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy. Apple abides by the “safe harbor” framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information collected by organizations in the European Economic Area and Switzerland. Learn more about the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Program.
</p>

<p>
Please note that personal information regarding individuals who reside in a member state of the European Economic Area (EEA) is jointly controlled by Apple Sales International in Cork, Ireland, and Apple UK Limited in Uxbridge, United Kingdom. Personal information collected in the EEA when using iTunes is controlled by iTunes SARL in Luxembourg.
</p>

<p>
Our Companywide Commitment to Your Privacy
</p>

<p>
To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to Apple employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.
