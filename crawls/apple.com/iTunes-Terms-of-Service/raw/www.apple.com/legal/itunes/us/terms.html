1-Click is a registered service mark of Amazon.com, Inc., used under license. 1-Click is a convenient feature that allows you to purchase or rent (as applicable) from the iTunes Store with a single click of your mouse or other input device. When accessing the iTunes Store on your computer, 1-Click purchasing or renting (as applicable) may be activated for all your transactions by selecting the "Don't ask me about buying ... again" check box in the "Are you sure you want to buy and download ... ?" dialog box that appears when a "Buy" button is clicked. (You may reset this selection at any time by clicking "Reset Warnings" in your Account.) When accessing the iTunes Store on your iPod or iPhone using Wi-Fi, 1-Click is activated for each transaction by pressing the button showing the price of the product, which reveals the "Buy" button. When 1-Click is activated, clicking the "Buy" button will start the download immediately and complete your transaction without any further steps. Transactions using 1-Click are subject to these Terms of Sale, including the Refund Policy set forth herein. When accessing the iTunes Store on your computer, you may turn off 1-Click and instead purchase (or rent) using a Shopping Cart by selecting "Buy using a Shopping Cart" under the "Store" tab in your preferences menu within the iTunes application. Using a Shopping Cart allows you to review and change the Products you have selected for purchase (or rental) before completing the transaction. The Shopping Cart functionality is not available when accessing the iTunes Store on your iPod or iPhone, or for Movie Rentals

PAYMENT METHODS

Billing to your credit card or to your PayPal account occurs at the time of purchase or rental (as applicable) or shortly thereafter. If the balance from an iTunes Card, iTunes Store Gift Certificate or Allowance Account is used for an iTunes Store transaction, the amount is deducted from your account or your iTunes Card (as the case may be) at the time of purchase or rental (as applicable.) If the total amount of the transaction is greater than the balance available in your iTunes Card, Gift Certificate or Allowance Account, your credit card, or PayPal account, will be charged for the balance.

</p>

<p>
If a transaction has been declined online due to credit card issues, or issues with your PayPal account, please ensure all data is correct and resubmit. If the transaction is not accepted online, you will be unable to use that card or your PayPal account (as the case may be) for your transaction and should use another credit card.

<p>
COMPLETE MY ALBUM ("CMA")
</p>

<p>
If you have acquired select songs or music videos from the iTunes Store, Apple may offer you the ability to "complete" the corresponding album (if any) by purchasing the remaining songs or music videos of the album at a price that is less than the full album price. Please note that for some albums (where the full album price equals the sum of the single prices of all its songs), completing the album using CMA does not reduce your price for the remaining songs or music videos compared to buying them individually. CMA may not be available for all songs or music videos you have acquired or will acquire from the iTunes Store, and availability of particular CMA offers is subject to change without notice. Albums that are no longer available for sale on the iTunes Store, partial albums and certain other albums are not eligible for CMA. Songs or music videos acquired through free promotions are not eligible for CMA, except in the case of certain select free content code promotions. CMA is not available for any content acquired from the iTunes Store other than songs and music videos. Except in the case of special promotions that Apple may conduct at its discretion, in some circumstances, you will have no more than 180 days from the time you acquire your first CMA-eligible song or video off a particular CMA-eligible album to accept that CMA offer.
</p>

<p>
For more information about CMA, please read the FAQ at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090421175224/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305232">http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305232</a>.
</p>

<p>
ITUNES PLUS
</p>

<p>
Select songs or music videos may be available on the iTunes Store in the iTunes Plus format. iTunes Plus content does not contain security technology that restricts your usage of such content, and is encoded at a higher audio bit rate than the DRM-protected songs or music videos available on the iTunes Store. iTunes Plus content also is subject to fewer Usage Rules; please see the iTunes Store Terms of Service for details.
</p>

<p>
You may upgrade songs and music videos you previously have purchased from the iTunes Store that are eligible for upgrade. Songs or music videos may be eligible for upgrade only if the same song or music video is available for sale on the iTunes Store in the iTunes Plus format at the time of the upgrade. The eligibility of particular songs and music videos for upgrade to iTunes Plus and your total upgrade offer are subject to change at any time. Before you upgrade, you will be shown the total price for the upgrade, and will have an opportunity to review the specific content that will be upgraded. The upgraded iTunes Plus versions of your content will replace the DRM-protected versions in your iTunes library, and the DRM-protected files will be moved to your Trash or Recycling Bin folder. For more information on how the upgrade price is calculated and details about the replacement of the DRM-protected versions, please review the FAQ (see below).
</p>

<p>
CMA may be available for iTunes Plus content, subject to the CMA terms and conditions set forth above. Upgrading prior purchases to iTunes Plus does not affect the time limits applicable to CMA availability.
</p>

Using the iTunes application and subject to a separate fee, you may be able to create ring tones, usable only on iPhones and no more than 30 seconds in length, from eligible songs that you have purchased from the iTunes Store and which reside in your iTunes Library. Eligibility for ring tone creation and purchase is determined at the time you choose to purchase the ring tone you have created, not at the time you originally purchase the song from the iTunes Store. The eligibility of particular songs for ring tone creation and purchase is subject to change at any time. Indications of ring tone eligibility for particular songs on the iTunes store or in your iTunes application are provided solely for convenience, and do not guarantee that the applicable song will be eligible for ring tone creation and purchase at any time in the future.

Purchaser must connect to iTunes and download any remaining episodes in the Season Pass or Multi-Pass within 90 days after the final purchased episode becomes available on iTunes (or such other time period as may be specified on the purchase page), after which such remaining episodes may no longer be available for download as part of the Season Pass or Multi-Pass purchase. Automatic renewal is available for Multi-Pass purchases. If automatic renewal is selected when you purchase a Multi-Pass, you will be charged the full price of each subsequent Multi-Pass cycle and the corresponding episodes will become available to you as set forth above, unless and until you cancel automatic renewal prior to the beginning of any such subsequent Multi-Pass cycle. Automatic renewal of Multi-Pass purchases may be disabled prior to purchase of the current Multi-Pass cycle by unchecking the "Automatically renew this Multi-Pass" check box in the purchase dialog box. In addition, Season Pass and Multi-Pass purchases may be reviewed, and automatic renewal may be selected or canceled for any current or future Multi-Pass that you have purchased, in the Manage Passes section of your Account. Once a subsequent Multi-Pass cycle has been purchased pursuant to an automatic renewal, it may no longer be cancelled and there are no refunds or returns.

<p>
TERMS OF SERVICE
</p>

<p>
THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND APPLE INC. ("APPLE") STATING THE TERMS THAT GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE ITUNES STORE SERVICE. THIS AGREEMENT - TOGETHER WITH ALL UPDATES, ADDITIONAL TERMS, SOFTWARE LICENSES, AND ALL OF APPLE'S RULES AND POLICIES - COLLECTIVELY CONSTITUTE THE "AGREEMENT" BETWEEN YOU AND APPLE. TO AGREE TO THESE TERMS, CLICK "AGREE." IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT CLICK "AGREE," AND DO NOT USE THE SERVICE. YOU MUST ACCEPT AND ABIDE BY THESE TERMS AS PRESENTED TO YOU: CHANGES, ADDITIONS, OR DELETIONS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE, AND APPLE MAY REFUSE ACCESS TO THE ITUNES STORE FOR NONCOMPLIANCE WITH ANY PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.
</p>

<p>
1. Definition of the iTunes Store Service. Apple is the provider of the iTunes Store (the "Service") that permits you to purchase or rent (as applicable) digital content, such as sound recordings and videos (including movies and television shows), games, software, and ring tones, under certain terms and conditions as set forth in this Agreement.
</p>

<p>
2. Age requirements for use of the Service. This Service is available for individuals aged 13 years or older. If you are 13 or older but under the age of 18, you should review these terms and conditions with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand these terms and conditions.
</p>

<p>
3. Objectionable Material. You understand that by using the Service, you may encounter content that may be deemed offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit language. Nevertheless, you agree to use the Service at your sole risk and that Apple shall have no liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable. Content types (including genres, sub-genres and Podcast categories and sub-categories and the like) and descriptions are provided for convenience, and you acknowledge and agree that Apple does not guarantee their accuracy.
</p>

<p>
4. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION. (1) To avoid muscle, joint or eye strain during video game play, you should always take frequent breaks from playing, and stop and take a longer rest if your eyes, hands, wrists, or arms become tired or sore or you feel any other discomfort. (2) A very small percentage of people may experience seizures or blackouts when exposed to flashing lights or patterns, including while playing video games or watching videos. Symptoms may include dizziness, nausea, involuntary movements, loss of awareness, altered vision, tingling, numbness, or other discomforts. Consult a doctor before playing video games if you have ever suffered these or other symptoms linked to seizures and/or epilepsy, and stop playing immediately and see a doctor if these or similar symptoms occur during game play. Parents should monitor their children’s video game play for signs of symptoms.
</p>

<p>
5. System Requirements. Use of the Service requires one or more compatible devices, Internet access (fees may apply), and certain software (fees may apply), and may require obtaining updates or upgrades from time to time. Because use of the Service involves hardware, software, and Internet access, your ability to use the Service may be affected by the performance of these factors. High speed Internet access is strongly recommended (and is required for Movie Rentals). You acknowledge and agree that such system requirements, which may be changed from time to time, are your responsibility. The Service is not part of any other product or offering, and no purchase or rental (as applicable) or obtaining of any other product shall be construed to represent or guarantee you access to the Service.

When you use the Genius feature, Apple will use this information and the contents of your iTunes library, as well as other information, to give personalized recommendations to you.
</p>

Apple may only use this information and combine it with aggregated information from the iTunes libraries of other users who also opt-in to this feature, your iTunes Store purchase history data, aggregated purchase history data from other iTunes Store users, and other information obtained from third parties, to:

</p>

<p>
If you would prefer we not collect and use information from your iTunes library in this manner, you should not enable the Genius feature. You can revoke your opt-in choice at any time by choosing to turn off the Genius feature from the Store menu. Upon opting-out, iTunes will no longer send information about your iTunes library to Apple. If you have elected to share your library from multiple computers, you need to turn off the Genius feature from each computer.

You agree not to attempt to, or assist another person to, circumvent, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise tamper with any of the security components related to such Usage Rules for any reason whatsoever.

<p>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
</p>

<p>
THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND APPLE INC. ("APPLE") STATING THE TERMS THAT GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE APP STORE SERVICE. THIS AGREEMENT - TOGETHER WITH ALL UPDATES, ADDITIONAL TERMS, SOFTWARE LICENSES, AND ALL OF APPLE'S RULES AND POLICIES - COLLECTIVELY CONSTITUTE THE "AGREEMENT" BETWEEN YOU AND APPLE. TO AGREE TO THESE TERMS, CLICK "AGREE." IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT CLICK "AGREE," AND DO NOT USE THE SERVICE. YOU MUST ACCEPT AND ABIDE BY THESE TERMS AS PRESENTED TO YOU: CHANGES, ADDITIONS, OR DELETIONS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE, AND APPLE MAY REFUSE ACCESS TO THE APP STORE FOR NONCOMPLIANCE WITH ANY PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.
</p>

<p>
1. DEFINITION OF THE APP STORE SERVICE. Apple is the provider of the App Store (the "Service") that permits you to license software products, such as games and applications, under certain terms and conditions as set forth in this Agreement.
</p>

<p>
2. AGE REQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF THE SERVICE. This Service is available for individuals aged 13 years or older. If you are 13 or older but under the age of 18, you should review these terms and conditions with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand these terms and conditions.
</p>

<p>
3. U.S. ONLY. The Service is available to you only in the United States and is not available in any other location. You agree not to use or attempt to use the Service from outside of the available territory. Apple may use technologies to verify such compliance.
</p>

<p>
4. LICENSE OF PRODUCTS. The software products made available through the Service (the “Products”) are licensed, not sold, to you. There are two (2) categories of Products offered through the Service, as follows: (i) those Products that have been developed, and are licensed to you, by Apple (the “Apple Products”); and (ii) those Products that have been developed, and are licensed to you, by a third party developer (the “Third Party Products”). The category of any particular Product (i.e., Apple Product or Third Party Product, as the case may be) is identified on the Service application.
</p>

<p>
Your license to each Product that you obtain through the Service is subject to the Licensed Application End User License Agreement set forth below, and you agree that the terms of the Licensed Application End User License Agreement will apply to each Apple Product and to each Third Party Product that you license through the Service, unless the Product is covered by a valid end user license agreement entered into between you and the licensor of the Product (the “Licensor”), in which case the Licensor’s end user license agreement will apply to that Product. The Licensor reserves all rights in and to the Product not expressly granted to you.
</p>

<p>
You acknowledge that the license you purchase to each Apple Product that you obtain through the Service is a binding agreement between you and Apple, and that the license you purchase to each Third Party Product is a binding agreement between you and the third party licensor of that Third Party Product (“the Application Provider”) only. The Application Provider of each Third Party Product is solely responsible for that Third Party Product, the content therein, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have not been disclaimed, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to that Third Party Product or your use of that Third Party Product. You acknowledge that you are purchasing the license to each Third Party Product from the Application Provider of that Third Party Product; Apple is acting as agent for the Application Provider in providing each such Third Party Product to you; Apple is not a party to the license between you and the Application Provider with respect to that Third Party Product; and Apple is not responsible for that Third Party Product, the content therein, or any warranties or claims that you or any other party may have relating to that Third Party Product or your use of that Third Party Product.
</p>

<p>
You acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of the Licensed Application End User License Agreement, or the Application Provider’s end user license agreement, as the case may be, for each Third Party Product, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the license to any such Third Party Product, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce such license against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.
</p>

<p>
All Products made available through the Service are licensed to end user customers only.
</p>

<p>
5. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS. Your use of the Service and transactions made through it are subject to any end-user agreements or other terms and conditions required for use of the software required for use of the Service, all of which are hereby made a part of this Agreement.
</p>

<p>
Use of the Service requires one or more compatible devices, Internet access (fees may apply), and certain software (fees may apply), and may require obtaining updates or upgrades from time to time. Because use of the Service involves hardware, software, and Internet access, your ability to use the Service may be affected by the performance of these factors. High speed Internet access is strongly recommended. You acknowledge and agree that such system requirements, which may be changed from time to time, are your responsibility.

</p>

<p>
c. You agree that your license of Products constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to use such Products solely in accordance with the Usage Rules, and that any other use of the Products may constitute a copyright infringement.

</p>

<p>
If a transaction has been declined online due to credit card issues, or issues with your PayPal account, please ensure all data is correct and resubmit. If the transaction is not accepted online, you will be unable to use that card or your PayPal account (as the case may be) for your transaction and should use another credit card.
</p>

<p>
